<h1>Teaching & Industry Experience</h1>

<p>
  From March 2024 to May 2025 I’ve worked as a private tutor, offering over 110 hours of one-on-one lessons. In addition, I have served as a teaching assistant for courses such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Advanced Functional Programming</em>, TU Wien, Prof. Dr. Jens Knoop (S25)</li>
  <li><em>Introduction to Programming 1</em>, TU Wien, Dr. Stefan Podlipnig (W24 &amp; S25)</li>
  <li><em>Introduction to Media Informatics</em> and <em>Human-computer Interaction</em>, TU Dresden, Prof. Dr. Gerhard Weber (W23)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the summer of 2022, I contributed to a Human-AI Interaction Design research project for aviation at <em>fortiss</em> — the research institute of the Free State of Bavaria for software-intensive systems and services — under the guidance of Zelun Tony Zhang. I also worked as a Software Engineering Working Student at <em>gutefrage.net</em>, a leading German Q&A platform, from July 2020 to September 2021, primarily mentored by Felix Bruckmeier.

  Earlier experiences include internships at <em>Ulysses</em> (a Leipzig-based Apple Design Award-winning writing app) and <em>tresmo</em> (an IoT company in Augsburg), both during high school summer breaks.

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hello, I'm Lou Elah SÜSSLIN
  <sub>(Feminine or neutral address; Pronouns: <i>she/her</i> or <i>they/them</i>)</sub>.
</p>

<p>
  I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a minor in Computational Linguistics from Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU Munich), completed in August 2023. Since March 2024, I have been based in Vienna, where I am pursuing an M.Sc. in Data Science at Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien).
</p>

<p>
  Alongside my studies, I’ve gained valuable teaching and research experience. As of October 2024, I’ve worked as a private tutor, offering over 100 hours of one-on-one lessons. In addition, I have served as a teaching assistant for courses such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Advanced Functional Programming</em>, TU Wien, Prof. Dr. Jens Knoop (S25)</li>
  <li><em>Introduction to Programming 1</em>, TU Wien, Dr. Stefan Podlipnig (W24 &amp; S25)</li>
  <li><em>Introduction to Media Informatics</em> and <em>Human-computer Interaction</em>, TU Dresden, Prof. Dr. Gerhard Weber (W23)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the summer of 2022, I contributed to a Human-AI Interaction Design research project for aviation at <em>fortiss</em> — the research institute of the Free State of Bavaria for software-intensive systems and services — under the guidance of Zelun Tony Zhang. I also worked as a Software Engineering Working Student at <em>gutefrage.net</em>, a leading German Q&A platform, from July 2020 to September 2021, primarily mentored by Felix Bruckmeier.
</p>

<p>
  Earlier experiences include internships at <em>Ulysses</em> (a Leipzig-based Apple Design Award-winning writing app) and <em>tresmo</em> (an IoT company in Augsburg), both during high school summer breaks.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of academia, I create and perform electronic music. As a DJ and producer, I perform under the artist name <em>Elah</em> (formerly <em>Awkward Endeavor</em>).<br>

<h2>Roots</h2>
<p>
  I was born in Augsburg-Oberhausen, Southern Germany, into a working-class family with deep local ties. Augsburg, situated in the historical region of Swabia, has been home to parts of my family since its early days as a "Free Imperial City," when Protestant weavers played a defining role in the city's social and economic fabric.
</p>

<p>
  My mother is a trained postal worker, and my father worked as a demolition contractor. Both of my grandfathers were butchers by trade and came from farming families rooted in Middle Swabia and East Allgovia–areas in the culturally rich Alpine Foreland. My grandmothers were both born and raised in Augsburg, with one having more recent family roots in Esslingen, near Stuttgart.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up in a 7.5 m² room in a postwar Zeilenbau apartment in the Wolfram quarter of Augsburg’s historic Textile District—a neighborhood long shaped by labor, resilience, and everyday life.
</p>

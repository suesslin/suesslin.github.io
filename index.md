<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hello, I'm Lou SÜSSLIN
  <sub>(Feminine address, Pronouns: <i>she/her</i>)</sub>.
</p>

<p>
  I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a minor in Computational Linguistics from Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU Munich), completed in August 2023. Currently, I'm a postgrad student of Logic and Artificial Intelligence at Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien).
</p>

<p>
  In addition to my academic studies, I’ve gained valuable experience in both teaching and industry — for a detailed overview, see the <a href="/career">Career</a> page. I’ve also contributed to research and publications in HCI, AI, and digital policy — see <a href="/academic-works">Academic Works</a> for the full list.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of academia, I create and perform electronic music. As a DJ and producer, I perform under the artist name <em>Elah</em> (formerly <em>Awkward Endeavor</em>).<br>

<h2>Roots</h2>
<p>
  I was born in Augsburg-Oberhausen, Southern Germany, into a working-class family with deep local ties. Augsburg, situated in the historical region of Swabia, has been home to parts of my family since its early days as a "Free Imperial City," when Protestant weavers played a defining role in the city's social and economic fabric.
</p>

<p>
  My mother is a trained postal worker, and my father worked as a demolition contractor. Both of my grandfathers were butchers by trade and came from farming families rooted in Middle Swabia and East Allgovia–areas in the culturally rich Alpine Foreland. My grandmothers were both born and raised in Augsburg, with one having more recent family roots in Esslingen, near Stuttgart.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up in a 7.5 m² room in a postwar Zeilenbau apartment in the Wolfram quarter of Augsburg’s historic Textile District—a neighborhood long shaped by labor, resilience, and everyday life.
